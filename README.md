# Chinese Character Helper
A simple tool to help identify and understand relationships between characters. I made this because I often became confused about characters I thought I had seen before in different contexts, often with different pronunciations. For instance, 得 (de5) the structural particle, or 得 (dei3) to need, or 得 (de2) to get or obtain.

Currently includes the characters from lessons 1 - 17 of the New Practical Chinese Reader 2nd Edition textbooks.

## TODO
- allow searching by character
- show dictionary entries when hovering characters
- render pinyin with tone marks instead of numbers
- better sizing/spacing so nodes don't overlap so much
- somehow link characters by similar components
- rename presets to something more meaningful
